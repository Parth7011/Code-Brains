Limited Accessibility: Some individuals are denied quality education due to such geographical and financial barriers, mostly found in remote or underprivileged locations.
 Lack of Flexibility: The conventional system of education is not flexible enough in time and does not open their doors for working professionals, parents, and others with commitments.
 Time Factor: Many students require the luxury of learning at their own discretion, which is not often permitted in other traditional teaching methods.
